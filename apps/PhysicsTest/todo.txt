[+] 1. Make interaction with user input.
[+] 2. Make ball to roll without non-central force (try friction on the ground).
Conclusion: Central force doesnt work with friction koefficient (1.0 for the ground).
	        Also don't forget to set a spinning friction. Or ball with rotate permanently in the other case.
	        Use non-central forces to make object to roll in desired direction or just explicitly use a torque.
	        Objects take into account friction value of surface they are rolling on.
	        So use 1.0 friction for surfaces like stone, marble, tree, etc (check for non-rolling objects).
	        And 0.1 (for example) for surfaces with low friction (like ice).
[-] 3. Remove all redundant code modules.
[-] 4. Make camera to face first object all the time.
[-] 5. Make first ball to roll over the second one.
