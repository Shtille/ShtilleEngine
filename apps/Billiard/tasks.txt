			We don't need a editor at all.
		- Need an additional menu to select point of hit by cue.
		- Main menu.
		- Victory menu.
		- Defeat menu.
	- Physics
		+ Add ghost object to test intersections.
		- Add texture for balls and test rotation.
		+ Make rack kinematic and test it.
		+ Determine how to make ball stop faster on lower speed.
		+ Determine optimal physics friction koefficients.
		+ Determine the moment the ball has stopped.
		+ Add custom mesh processing for entity.
		+ Use separate mesh for table bed.
		+ Use separate mesh for table cushions.
		+ Use simplified physics objects (boxes) for cushions.
		+ Add surface database class.
	- Graphics
		+ Add another shader for cue in disabled state.
		- Add textures.
		- Add realistic lighting model.
		- Add logotype rendering (need skybox and logotype model).
	- Controls
		- Desktop
			+ Left and right keys to rotate cue left and right respectively.
			+ Up and down keys to increase and decrease cue angle respectively.
			+ Space key to hit the cue ball.
		[-] Mobile
	- Gameplay
		+ Add cue hit animation.

		+ Make cue ball hittable by cue.
		- Add balls respawn.
		- Add cue ball respawn.
	- Audio
		By now we are skipping this phase.
