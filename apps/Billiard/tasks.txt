- Game
	- Design
		+ Editor
			We don't need a editor at all.
		- Need an additional menu to select point of hit by cue.
		- Main menu.
			+ Number of players option.
			- Game mode option.
			- Camera mode option.
		- Victory menu.
			- Show players' scores.
		- Defeat menu.
			- Show players' scores.
	- Physics
		+ Add ghost object to test intersections.
		- Add texture for balls and test rotation.
		+ Make rack kinematic and test it.
		+ Determine how to make ball stop faster on lower speed.
		+ Determine optimal physics friction koefficients.
		+ Determine the moment the ball has stopped.
		+ Add custom mesh processing for entity.
		+ Use separate mesh for table bed.
		+ Use separate mesh for table cushions.
		+ Use simplified physics objects (boxes) for cushions.
		+ Add surface database class.
	- Graphics
		+ Add another shader for cue in disabled state.
		- Add textures.
		- Add realistic lighting model.
		- Add logotype rendering (need skybox and logotype model).
	- Controls
		+ Make universal controls for mobile and desktop applications.
			+ Slider to control cue rotation angle.
			+ Button to hit the cue ball.
		- Make better look for controls.
	- Gameplay
		+ Add different camera modes.
		+ Enhance game logics.
		+ Add cue hit animation.
		+ Add rack removing animation.
		- Show cue intersections with other objects (don't let hit in this case).
			+ with balls
			- with table
		+ Write current game status (some message, a.e.).
		+ Make cue ball hittable by cue.
		- Add cue ball respawn (user should choose respawn position).
	- Audio
		By now we are skipping this phase.
	- Misc
		+ Count players' scores.
		- Add skybox loading with a custom descriptor.
		+ Add a new (internal) format that we gonna save models in.
		+ Add application that will convert models from one format to another.
		+ Add loading of HDR textures.
- Engine
	- Graphics
		- Fix void Quaternion::Set(const Vector3& from, const Vector3& at)
		- Add animation controller.
		- Add debug renderer.
		- Add height map mesh object.
		- Add height map decal mesh object.
	- UI
		+ Add slider class.
		+ Add button class.
		+ Make universal board class.
	- Misc
		- Vertex format should be removed because of having vertex array object.
