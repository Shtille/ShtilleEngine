- Game
	- Design
		+ Editor
			We don't need a editor at all.
		- Need an additional menu to select point of hit by cue.
	- Physics
		- Add texture for balls and test rotation.
		- Make rack kinematic and test it.
		+ Determine how to make ball stop faster on lower speed.
		+ Determine optimal physics friction koefficients.
		+ Determine the moment the ball has stopped.
		+ Add custom mesh processing for entity.
		+ Use separate mesh for table bed.
		+ Use separate mesh for table cushions.
		+ Use simplified physics objects (boxes) for cushions.
		+ Add surface database class.
	- Graphics
		- Use a single shader for rendering both textured and non textured objects.
		- Add textures.
		- Add realistic lighting model.
		- Add logotype rendering (need skybox and logotype model).
	- Controls
		- Desktop
			- Left and right keys to rotate cue left and right respectively.
			- Up and down keys to increase and decrease cue angle respectively.
			- Space key to hit the cue ball.
		[-] Mobile
	- Gameplay
		- Write current game status (some message, a.e.).
		- Make cue ball hittable by cue.
		- Add balls respawn.
		- Add cue ball respawn.
	- Audio
		By now we are skipping this phase.
	- Misc
		- Add skybox loading with a custom descriptor.
		+ Add a new (internal) format that we gonna save models in.
		+ Add application that will convert models from one format to another.
		+ Add loading of HDR textures.
